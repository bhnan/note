"Stay hungry, stay foolish", said by Steve Jobs in the commencement speech at ~~the~~ Stanford University. Admittedly, this spirit is extremely crucial to both personal development and social progress. If you examine successful the life journeys of ~~the~~ successful people, you will most likely find a noteworthy common ground: the more successful they are, the more they crave knowledge. Bertrand Russell, precisely with the enthusiasm for search of knowledge, completed more than 40 books in his whole life. Hua LuoGeng, although he had dropped out ~~in~~ <mark style="background: #b8f3b8;">at </mark>an early age, still persevered in learning and eventually was praised as the founder and pioneer of the numerous mathematical research field. The passion for knowledge, simple but overwhelming strong, has governed their life, thus resulting in their significant contributions in their field.
All in all, keeping eagerness for knowledge is of great significance. Accordingly we should spare no effort to arm ourselves with as much as knowledge as possible. Always remember "live and learn".

There are two man's reactions remind us that we should attempt to seek solutions when problems occur, instead of simply grumbling.
Complain is hurting: you don't skip to the workplace or school with a song in the heart, disappointed about current situations and pessimistic about the future.
Actually, as a normal way to vent our emotions, it's blameless to complain once in a while, yet complaining all the time not only never fixes problems, but generates bad influences on other people, thus draining the pleasure of life.
Such a negative attitude will weaken people's will and impede people from addressing problems, leaving them trapped in the mud of problems.
Therefore, we should stop complaining, for there are so many reasons rendering us confident in our life. As difficult as it may be at times, we are supposed to endeavor to try it out.
Therefore, when facing problems or difficulties, instead of making useless complaints, we ought to analyze the situations reasonably and then positively seek solutions.
In fact, we should appreciate the problems in our life, for by means of settling these problems, our individual improvement will be achieved, and thus social development will be obtained.
