介绍自己的本科学校：I come from shanxi  agricultural university, where is located shanxi taigu. Our University is famous of agricultural. The most impressed for me is that  the air in our playground always mixed up the smell of cow manure, Because there are pasture near our campus.

本科学了哪些科目：data struct (DS); operating system (OS); computer networks;(CN) computer organization (CO). As basic subjects of CS, it is important of understand how computers work, how the internet was formed and how to implement them through coding.

自我介绍：Good moring, respected professor! It is my honor to be here for your interview. My name is bianhaonan. I am a graduate from shanxi agricultural university whit a major in software engineering.
I passed CET-6 exam. I have also done a lot of programming practice and participated in the PAT competition (advanced level), achieving good results. During my undergraduate studies, i self-taught myself knowledge in the field of network security. In the my spare time, i also explore things that interest me.
This is all for my self-introduction.

为什么考研：the undergraduate major was not my ideal major, it's more like an engineer than a scientist. I don't just want to know how to use, but to understand. So i chose to continue study.

为什么选择西电：xidian has  the top network security department. It has strong academic atmosphere and resource what i have always dreamed of.  

兴趣：我喜欢打羽毛球。刚开始觉得很简单，很容易上手就接触了一下。时间久了，发现羽毛球也自己策略，而不是简单的接发球。慢慢就喜欢上了打羽毛球。
I enjoy playing badminton. At first, I thought it was very simple and easy to pick up. After playing for a while, I realized that badminton requires its own strategies, and it's not just about hitting the shuttlecock back and forth. Slowly, I fell in love with playing badminton.

本科挂科和成绩的原因：我的挂科集中在大一的时候，那时候比较迷茫，一下没有使用大学生活，所以挂科偏多。后来我找到方向之后，对本专业的课程没有十分上心，所以整体成绩也不太好。我的研究生生活肯定不会这样。我很喜欢网络安全这个方向，我对 ai 方面的兴趣也很浓厚。
"My academic performance suffered during my freshman year because I was feeling lost and didn't fully embrace college life, resulting in not passing some courses. Later on, even though I found my direction, I didn't pay enough attention to the courses in my major, leading to overall unsatisfactory academic performance. However, I am confident that my graduate studies will not be the same. I have a strong interest in network security and also have a keen interest in AI."

家庭："My family is a typical household of three, living an ordinary life. My parents have always done their best to provide me with the best life possible, and I am deeply grateful for their efforts."
