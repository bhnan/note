During my undergraduate studies, i self-taught myself knowledge in the field of network security. In the my spare time, i also explore things that interest me.
This is all for my self-introduction.

I enjoy playing badminton. At first, I thought it was very simple and easy to pick up. After playing for a while, I realized that badminton requires its own strategies, and it's not just about hitting the shuttlecock back and forth. Slowly, I fell in love with playing badminton.
