介绍自己的本科学校：I come from shanxi  agricultural university, where is located shanxi taigu. Our University is famous of agricultural. The most impressed for me is that  the air in our playground always mixed up the smell of cow manure, Because there are pasture near our campus.

本科学了哪些科目：data struct (DS); operating system (OS); computer networks;(CN) computer organization (CO). As basic subjects of CS, it is important of understand how computers work, how the internet was formed and how to implement them through coding.

自我介绍：Good moring, respected professors! It is my honor to be here for your interview. My name is bianhaonan. I am a graduate from shanxi agricultural university with%%%% a major in software engineering.
During my undergraduate studies, I passed the CET-6 exam and also gained practical programming experience by participating in the advanced level PAT competition, achieving good results. In addition, I independently taught myself knowledge in the field of network security and AI, which has become my area of interest. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring topics related to this field and broadening my knowledge. I could be a strong candidate for further study in network security and AI due to my passion, self-motivation, and hard work.
This is all for my self-introduction. Thanks for your attention.

为什么考研：the undergraduate major was not my ideal major, it's more like an engineer than a scientist. I don't just want to know how to use, but to understand. So i chose to continue study.

为什么选择西电：xidian has  the top network security department. It has strong academic atmosphere and resource what i have always dreamed of.  

兴趣：我喜欢打羽毛球。刚开始觉得很简单，很容易上手就接触了一下。时间久了，发现羽毛球也自己策略，而不是简单的接发球。慢慢就喜欢上了打羽毛球。
I enjoy playing badminton. At first, I thought it was very simple and easy to pick up. After playing for a while, I realized that badminton requires its own strategies, and it's not just about hitting the shuttlecock back and forth. Slowly, I began to enjoy playing badminton.

本科挂科和成绩的原因：我的挂科集中在大一的时候，那时候比较迷茫，一下没有使用大学生活，所以挂科偏多。后来我找到方向之后，对本专业的课程没有十分上心，所以整体成绩也不太好。我的研究生生活肯定不会这样。我很喜欢网络安全这个方向，我对 ai 方面的兴趣也很浓厚。
"My academic performance suffered during my freshman year because I was feeling lost and didn't fully embrace college life, resulting in not passing some courses. Later on, even though I found my direction, I didn't pay enough attention to the courses in my major, leading to overall unsatisfactory academic performance. However, I am confident that my graduate studies will not be the same. I have a strong interest in network security and also have a keen interest in AI."

家庭：We are a normal family of three, living an ordinary life. My parents strive to give me the best life possible, and I am very appreciative of them.
